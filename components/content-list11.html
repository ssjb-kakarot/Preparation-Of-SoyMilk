                >Calories: Approximately 80-110 calories, depending on whether
                it's sweetened or unsweetened. Protein: About 7-9 grams, making
                it a good source of plant-based protein. Fat: Typically 4-5
                grams, mostly unsaturated fats, which are heart-healthy.
                Carbohydrates: Around 4-5 grams, primarily from naturally
                occurring sugars in soybeans. Fiber: Approximately 1-2 grams,
                providing a small but beneficial amount of dietary fiber.
                Calcium: Fortified soy milk provides about 200-300 milligrams of
                calcium, similar to cow's milk. However, the exact amount can
                vary depending on the brand and fortification level. Vitamin D:
                Fortified soy milk often contains vitamin D, ranging from 100 to
                300 IU (International Units) per serving. This vitamin is
                crucial for bone health and immune function. Vitamin B12: Some
                brands of soy milk are fortified with vitamin B12, which is
                important for nerve function and red blood cell production,
                especially for those following a vegan or vegetarian diet. Iron:
                Soy milk contains about 1-2 milligrams of iron per serving, but
                this can vary depending on fortification. Iron is essential for
                oxygen transport in the blood and overall energy levels.
                Potassium: Approximately 300-350 milligrams, contributing to
                healthy blood pressure and muscle function. Phosphorus: Around
                100-150 milligrams, aiding in bone health and energy metabolism.
                Magnesium: Typically 20-30 milligrams, supporting muscle and
                nerve function, as well as bone health. Riboflavin (Vitamin B2):
                Soy milk contains around 0.2-0.3 milligrams, helping with energy
                production and metabolism. Niacin (Vitamin B3): About 0.5-1
                milligram, supporting overall cellular function and metabolism.
                Folate (Vitamin B9): Approximately 15-20 micrograms, crucial for
                cell division and DNA synthesis. Phytochemicals: Soy milk
                contains phytochemicals such as isoflavones, which have
                antioxidant properties and may offer various health benefits,
                including reduced risk of heart disease and certain
                cancers.</span
