                >Soy milk, a nutritious beverage, is made by extracting a milky
                liquid from ground, cooked soybeans. This creamy white liquid,
                similar in appearance to cow's milk, offers a rich source of
                protein and iron. Unlike dairy milk, soy milk is
                cholesterol-free, low in fat, and low in sodium. While it may
                lack calcium naturally, it can be fortified for those needing
                additional calcium intake, especially growing children. Soy milk
                is a suitable alternative for individuals allergic to cow's milk
                or those with lactose intolerance, as it is free of lactose, the
                natural sugar found in dairy milk.</span

                >here's a step-by-step guide to making soy milk at home: Soak
                Soybeans: Begin by soaking 1 cup of dried soybeans in water
                overnight or for at least 8 hours. Use enough water to cover the
                soybeans by a few inches. Drain and Rinse: After soaking, drain
                and rinse the soybeans thoroughly under cold water. Blend with
                Water: In a blender, combine the soaked soybeans with 3-4 cups
                of fresh water. The exact amount of water depends on how thick
                or thin you want your soy milk to be. Start with 3 cups and
                adjust as needed. Blend Until Smooth: Blend the soybeans and
                water on high speed for about 2-3 minutes, or until you have a
                smooth mixture. Strain: Place a fine mesh strainer or
                cheesecloth over a large bowl or pitcher. Pour the blended
                mixture through the strainer, allowing the liquid to separate
                from the solids. You may need to do this in batches depending on
                the size of your strainer. Press to Extract Liquid: Press down
                on the solids with a spoon or spatula to extract as much liquid
                (soy milk) as possible. Sweeten and Flavor (Optional): If
                desired, sweeten the soy milk with sugar, honey, or another
                sweetener to taste. You can also add flavorings such as vanilla
                extract or cocoa powder for additional flavor. Refrigerate:
                Transfer the strained soy milk to a clean container and
                refrigerate. It will keep for about 3-4 days. Enjoy: Use your
                homemade soy milk in recipes, smoothies, or as a dairy-free
                alternative in coffee or tea. That's it! You've successfully
                made soy milk at home. Adjust the quantities of ingredients
                according to your preferences and enjoy the nutritious and
                delicious beverage.</span

                >here's a detailed breakdown of the average nutritional
                information for soy milk per 240ml (1 cup) serving: Calories:
                Approximately 80-110 calories, depending on whether it's
                sweetened or unsweetened. Protein: About 7-9 grams, making it a
                good source of plant-based protein. Fat: Typically 4-5 grams,
                mostly unsaturated fats, which are heart-healthy. Carbohydrates:
                Around 4-5 grams, primarily from naturally occurring sugars in
                soybeans. Fiber: Approximately 1-2 grams, providing a small but
                beneficial amount of dietary fiber. Calcium: Fortified soy milk
                provides about 200-300 milligrams of calcium, similar to cow's
                milk. However, the exact amount can vary depending on the brand
                and fortification level. Vitamin D: Fortified soy milk often
                contains vitamin D, ranging from 100 to 300 IU (International
                Units) per serving. This vitamin is crucial for bone health and
                immune function. Vitamin B12: Some brands of soy milk are
                fortified with vitamin B12, which is important for nerve
                function and red blood cell production, especially for those
                following a vegan or vegetarian diet. Iron: Soy milk contains
                about 1-2 milligrams of iron per serving, but this can vary
                depending on fortification. Iron is essential for oxygen
                transport in the blood and overall energy levels. Potassium:
                Approximately 300-350 milligrams, contributing to healthy blood
                pressure and muscle function. Phosphorus: Around 100-150
                milligrams, aiding in bone health and energy metabolism.
                Magnesium: Typically 20-30 milligrams, supporting muscle and
                nerve function, as well as bone health. Riboflavin (Vitamin B2):
                Soy milk contains around 0.2-0.3 milligrams, helping with energy
                production and metabolism. Niacin (Vitamin B3): About 0.5-1
                milligram, supporting overall cellular function and metabolism.
                Folate (Vitamin B9): Approximately 15-20 micrograms, crucial for
                cell division and DNA synthesis. Phytochemicals: Soy milk
                contains phytochemicals such as isoflavones, which have
                antioxidant properties and may offer various health benefits,
                including reduced risk of heart disease and certain cancers.
                Keep in mind that these values are approximate and can vary
                based on factors such as brand, fortification, and specific
                ingredients used. Always check the nutrition label on the
                product for the most accurate information.</span
