                        >Calories: Approximately 80-110 calories, depending on
                        whether it's sweetened or unsweetened. Protein: About
                        7-9 grams, making it a good source of plant-based
                        protein. Fat: Typically 4-5 grams, mostly unsaturated
                        fats, which are heart-healthy. Carbohydrates: Around 4-5
                        grams, primarily from naturally occurring sugars in
                        soybeans. Fiber: Approximately 1-2 grams, providing a
                        small but beneficial amount of dietary fiber. Calcium:
                        Fortified soy milk provides about 200-300 milligrams of
                        calcium, similar to cow's milk. However, the exact
                        amount can vary depending on the brand and fortification
                        level. Vitamin D: Fortified soy milk often contains
                        vitamin D, ranging from 100 to 300 IU (International
                        Units) per serving. This vitamin is crucial for bone
                        health and immune function. Vitamin B12: Some brands of
                        soy milk are fortified with vitamin B12, which is
                        important for nerve function and red blood cell
                        production, especially for those following a vegan or
                        vegetarian diet. Iron: Soy milk contains about 1-2
                        milligrams of iron per serving, but this can vary
                        depending on fortification. Iron is essential for oxygen
                        transport in the blood and overall energy levels.
                        Potassium: Approximately 300-350 milligrams,
                        contributing to healthy blood pressure and muscle
                        function. Phosphorus: Around 100-150 milligrams, aiding
                        in bone health and energy metabolism. Magnesium:
                        Typically 20-30 milligrams, supporting muscle and nerve
                        function, as well as bone health. Riboflavin (Vitamin
                        B2): Soy milk contains around 0.2-0.3 milligrams,
                        helping with energy production and metabolism. Niacin
                        (Vitamin B3): About 0.5-1 milligram, supporting overall
                        cellular function and metabolism. Folate (Vitamin B9):
                        Approximately 15-20 micrograms, crucial for cell
                        division and DNA synthesis. Phytochemicals: Soy milk
                        contains phytochemicals such as isoflavones, which have
                        antioxidant properties and may offer various health
                        benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and
                        certain cancers.</span
